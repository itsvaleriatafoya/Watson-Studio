# Watson-Studio
Using IBM Cloud, I accessed Cloud Object Storage (for the storage of the non-structured data of my app), then I setted up the Watson Machine Learning service and Watson Studio (for the AI models). Also used Wtson OpenScale!
**This is the documentation for my project during the workshop imparted by the Toronto Machine Learning Society during the 2022 MLOps World Annual Summit**

💥Importing a ML model
💥Deploying the model
💥Score and monitor data
💥Configure quality, fairness and drift
The aim was also to provide documentation on fairness metrics
