# Watson-Studio
Using IBM Cloud, I accessed Cloud Object Storage (for the storage of the non-structured data of my app), then I setted up the Watson Machine Learning service and Watson Studio (for the AI models). Also used Wtson OpenScale!

**This is the documentation for my project during the workshop imparted by the Toronto Machine Learning Society during the 2022 MLOps World Annual Summit**

ðŸ’¥Importing a ML model
<br/>
ðŸ’¥Deploying the model
<br/>
ðŸ’¥Score and monitor data
<br/>
ðŸ’¥Configure quality, fairness and drift
<br/>
The aim was also to provide documentation on fairness metrics
